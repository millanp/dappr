Installation
============

1. Install the package

.. code-block:: python

	pip install dappr

2. Add it to your INSTALLED_APPS

.. code-block:: python

	INSTALLED_APPS = [
		...
		'django.contrib.messages',
		'django.contrib.staticfiles',
		'dappr',
	]

3. Make sure that the builtin django auth urls are activated. Remember that you will need to write `some templates <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/default/#all-authentication-views>`_ for these urls to work properly!

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^auth/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    ]

4. Include the dappr urls

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^auth/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
        url(r'^registration/', include('dappr.urls')),
    ]

5. Set up email sending in Django. This will probably involve getting an account with an SMTP service like `SendGrid <https://sendgrid.com/>`_, then following their instructions. In SendGrid's case, you will need to add the following to your settings.py:

.. code-block:: python

    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
    # Make sure this information is not committed to a public repo!
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'sendgrid_username'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'sendgrid_password'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True

6. Migrate the database::

.. code-block:: python

	python manage.py migrate
