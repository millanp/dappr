Why use Dappr?
==============

Purpose
-------

Dappr provides a user registration system with an admin approval step.
Sound familiar? That is because the purpose of Dappr is very similar to
that of `django-inspectional-registration <https://github.com/lambdalisue/django-inspectional-registration>`_, a popular app based off of 
`django-registration <https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration/>`_ that
does just that.

What makes Dappr better?
------------------------

To put it simply, the other options are ridiculously overcomplicated.
